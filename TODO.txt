read up on:
  - CW alerts
  - explore Serverless and how it approaches things (for inspiration and education)

on the fresh brain: 
  fun experimentation:
    - better combinators for Config - connecting things together. Try using typeclasses to constrain combinators.

  figure out:
    - how to call lambda straight from the ng2 app with auth
      - make possible defining standalone lambdas
    - use CW alerts
    - how to test qmuli apps

  fix:
    - logging!
    - qmuli.yaml
    


features:
  - add more DDB functionality


use cases:
  - followup
    - auth, JWT
  - use cases from Imagen:
    - copying data from DDB table to an S3 object or to another DDB table


brain-dead tasks:
  - test cover the rest of stuff
  - document code to put on hackage


documentation:
  - blog posts
    - setup a blog
